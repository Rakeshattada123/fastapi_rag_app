--- TRANSCRIPT WITH EMOTION ANALYSIS ---

[00:00:00 --> 00:00:05] 😐 If you're not satisfied with your life, then watch this video until the end.
[00:00:05 --> 00:00:08] 😐 This story is going to change your life.
[00:00:09 --> 00:00:13] 😢 Once upon a time a crow was very unhappy with his life.
[00:00:13 --> 00:00:16] 🤢 One day he started crying while sitting on a tree.
[00:00:17 --> 00:00:19] 🤢 A monk was sitting under the tree.
[00:00:20 --> 00:00:24] 😐 Just then, a drop of the crow's tears fell on the monk's cheek.
[00:00:24 --> 00:00:28] 🤢 The monk raised his head and saw that the crow was crying.
[00:00:28 --> 00:00:31] 😮 The monk asked, why are you crying?
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:35] 😢 The crow said, oh wise one, I'm very upset with my life.
[00:00:35 --> 00:00:39] 😠 No one loves me. People shoot me away in disgrace and don't give me anything to eat.
[00:00:39 --> 00:00:43] 😠 Everyone hates me. Death is better than such a life.
[00:00:43 --> 00:00:47] 🤢 Hearing the crow's words, the monk's heart was filled with compassion.
[00:00:47 --> 00:00:51] 😐 He said, we should learn to be happy in whatever condition we are in.
[00:00:51 --> 00:00:54] 🤢 But the crow didn't understand the monk's words and kept crying.
[00:00:55 --> 00:01:00] 😠 The monk said, don't be upset. Tell me what you want to be.
[00:01:00 --> 00:01:02] 😐 I can make you that with my mantra.
[00:01:03 --> 00:01:09] 😄 The crow became happy and said, oh blessed one, if you want to do me a favor, then please make me a swan.
[00:01:09 --> 00:01:12] 😠 He said, okay, I will make you a swan.
[00:01:12 --> 00:01:16] 😐 But first go to a swan and ask whether he is happy with his life or not.
[00:01:16 --> 00:01:20] 😐 You go and find out, and until then I will wait for you here.
[00:01:21 --> 00:01:24] 😄 The crow happily flew away to meet a swan.
[00:01:24 --> 00:01:26] 🤢 The swan was swimming in a pond.
[00:01:26 --> 00:01:30] 😮 He went to the swan and said, how beautiful you are.
[00:01:30 --> 00:01:33] 😐 You are as white as milk. Everyone loves you.
[00:01:33 --> 00:01:36] 😄 You must be the happiest bird in the world.
[00:01:36 --> 00:01:39] 😢 The swan said, no my friend, I'm not happy.
[00:01:39 --> 00:01:43] 😐 There are so many beautiful colors in the world, but I don't have any colors.
[00:01:43 --> 00:01:48] 😄 White is nothing. I think the parrot must be the happiest bird in the world.
[00:01:48 --> 00:01:50] 😄 It's so colorful.
[00:01:50 --> 00:01:53] 🤢 Hearing this, the crow flew away and reached the parrot.
[00:01:53 --> 00:01:57] 😄 Oh parrot, he said, you are so colorful and beautiful.
[00:01:57 --> 00:02:00] 😄 You must be the happiest bird in the world.
[00:02:00 --> 00:02:02] 😢 No my friend, I'm not happy.
[00:02:02 --> 00:02:04] 🤢 People keep parrots in cages.
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:08] 😨 I'm always afraid that someone may hold me and lock me in a cage.
[00:02:08 --> 00:02:10] 😄 I think the peacock is the happiest one.
[00:02:10 --> 00:02:12] 😐 He is more colorful than me.
[00:02:12 --> 00:02:16] 🤢 Hearing this, the crow flew around looking for a peacock.
[00:02:16 --> 00:02:19] 🤢 He finally found a peacock in a cage in a zoo.
[00:02:19 --> 00:02:22] 😄 Hundreds of people had gathered to see him.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:27] 😐 After they left, he approached the peacock and said, dear peacock, you are so beautiful.
[00:02:27 --> 00:02:30] 😄 Thousands of people come to see you.
[00:02:30 --> 00:02:33] 😨 Look at me when they see me. They immediately shoo me away.
[00:02:33 --> 00:02:37] 😄 I think you are the happiest bird on the planet.
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:42] 😄 The peacock replied, I always thought I was the most beautiful and happiest bird on the planet.
[00:02:42 --> 00:02:45] 😄 But because of my beauty, I'm entrapped in this zoo.
[00:02:45 --> 00:02:50] 🤢 When people pluck my colorful feathers to make decorative things, it hurts a lot.
[00:02:50 --> 00:02:52] 😢 I'm not happy my friend.
[00:02:52 --> 00:02:56] 😮 The crow was surprised to hear this from the peacock.
[00:02:56 --> 00:03:01] 😐 He asked him, if you are not happy, then who is the happiest bird in the world?
[00:03:01 --> 00:03:10] 😐 The peacock said, I have examined the zoo very carefully and realized that you, the crow, are the only bird not kept in a cage.
[00:03:10 --> 00:03:12] 😐 People don't try to catch or entrap you.
[00:03:12 --> 00:03:17] 😄 For the past few days I have been thinking that if I were a crow, I could happily roam everywhere.
[00:03:17 --> 00:03:18] 😢 I could be free.
[00:03:18 --> 00:03:21] 🤢 Hearing this, he came back to the monk.
[00:03:21 --> 00:03:24] 😄 For the first time, the crow was happy to be a crow.
[00:03:24 --> 00:03:28] 😐 He said, oh wise one, I don't want to be anything else.
[00:03:28 --> 00:03:30] 😐 I'm fine as I am.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:36] 😢 In our lives, we often make unnecessary comparisons with others, become sad and curse ourselves.
[00:03:36 --> 00:03:39] 🤢 This leads to a vicious cycle of unhappiness.
[00:03:39 --> 00:03:43] 😐 You should learn to be happy with what you have instead of looking at what you don't have.
[00:03:43 --> 00:03:46] 😐 There will always be someone who has more or less than you do.
[00:03:46 --> 00:03:50] 😐 If you keep comparing yourself with others, you will never be happy.
[00:03:50 --> 00:03:55] 😄 A person who is satisfied with what they have is the happiest person in the world.
[00:03:56 --> 00:03:58] 😐 Don't compare yourself to anyone in life.
[00:03:58 --> 00:04:02] 😢 If you do so, you are the saddest person in the world.
[00:04:09 --> 00:04:12] 🙏 Thank you for watching!
